# CHESS
Chess on Linux Terminal

Same rules, same pieces, nothing changed.
Input example: "e2e4" press enter. (or "e2 e4")
Input takes first 2 chars as the source square, the second one as the destination.
In case of invalid input, the game waits until the move or the input will be valid.
Supported: pawn enPassant capturing, stalemate, automatic queen promotion.

Future considerations: Create Custom mode. Keep move database. Pawn promotion modes.
